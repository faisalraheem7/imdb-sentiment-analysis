# IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

This project is a simple machine learning application that predicts whether a movie review is **positive** or **negative** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to understand how text data can be processed and used in a machine learning model for sentiment classification.

## Dataset
The IMDb movie review dataset is used in this project. It contains movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.

Dataset source:  
https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordnlp/imdb

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Google Colab
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Machine Learning Algorithm
- Logistic Regression

## Methodology
1. Load the IMDb dataset from Hugging Face  
2. Convert text data into numerical form using TF-IDF  
3. Train a Logistic Regression model  
4. Evaluate the model using accuracy and classification report  

## Result
The trained model successfully classifies movie reviews as positive or negative with good accuracy.

## Learning Outcome
Through this project, I learned:
- How to work with real-world text datasets  
- Basic NLP preprocessing techniques  
- How to train and evaluate a machine learning classification model
